# üíç RingTool
RingTool is an open platform for health sensing and data analysis with smart rings. It processes raw **PPG** and **IMU** signals from ring sensors to estimate cardiovascular parameters (HR, RR, SpO2, BP). It offers configurable modules for data preprocessing, physics-based algorithms, supervised learning models (**ResNet**, **InceptionTime**, **Transformer**, **Mamba**), and systematic evaluation. The platform is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing the community to build custom solutions for a wide range of health and wellness applications.

### Data Collection
Our data was collected from two certain protocols.

> **Stimulus-evoked data collection procedure across physiological states.** The protocol consists of three main activities: (1) A 10-minute seated resting, (2) A 9-minute supervised low-oxygen simulation, and (3) Two 2-minute sessions of deep squat exercises. Blood pressure measurements were taken before and after each activity, while physiological data was continuously recorded by our custom rings and periodically measured by commercial rings for comparison.
![Health Experiment](figures/healthExperiment.png)

> **Data collection procedure across daily activities.** The protocol consists of five activity segments: (1) A 30-minute seated resting, (2) 5-minute sitting and talking, (3) 5-minute head movement, (4) 5-minute standing, and (5) 5-minute walking in place. Participants wore the oximeter, Ring 1 (reflective), Ring 2 (transmissive), and respiratory band throughout all activities.

### Prepare Your Own Data
You can follow our data collection protocol to build your own ring-based dataset. To ensure compatibility with our pipeline, your dataset should follow the same format --- a directory containing  `.pkl` files organized as shown below:

``` 
rings/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ subject_ringtype.pkl
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ id, start, end, fs
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ir, red, ax, ay, az, bvp, resp (np.array)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hr, resp_rr, spo2, samsung_hr, oura_hr, BP_sys, BP_dia (numeric)
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Experiment, Label (string)
```
Each `.pkl` file contains multi-modal physiological data collected from smart rings. Sensor signals (ir, red, ax, ay, az, bvp, resp) are stored as np.array, while other entries (e.g., hr, spo2, BP_sys, Label) are scalar values or strings. Data is synchronized and annotated with timestamps.


## üìä Benchmark
For each parameter, we compare both physics-based and supervised learning approaches, examining the performance differences between reflective (Ring 1) and transmissive (Ring 2) sensing modalities across various user activities and physiological states. The best results for each task are summarized in the below table.

| Task | Method / Ring | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | Pearson | Method / Ring | MAE | RMSE | MAPE | Pearson |
|------|---------------|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
|      | **Ring 1 (Reflective)**|            |             |             |                | **Ring 2 (Transmissive)**|          |             |             |                |
| HR   | ResNet        | 5.18       | 8.96        | 6.99        | 0.73           | ResNet        | 8.09       | 11.51       | 10.49       | 0.37           |

_For all cardiovascular parameters: MAE = Mean Absolute Error (HR/RR: BPM, BP: mmHg, SpO2: %), RMSE = Root Mean Square Error (HR/RR: BPM, BP: mmHg, SpO2: %), MAPE = Mean Absolute Percentage Error (%), Pearson = Pearson Correlation Coefficient_



## ‚ú® Features
### ‚öôÔ∏è Toolkit Configuration
Built with Python/PyTorch, RingTool allows customization of:
* **Data Splits:** Train/validation/test sets, k-fold cross-validation.
* **Training:** Learning rate, batch size, optimizer, epochs.
* **I/O:** Select sensor channels (PPG wavelengths, IMU) and target outputs (HR, RR, SpO2, BP).
* **Methods:** Choose between physics-based and supervised learning approaches.
* **Filtering:** Parameter-specific filter settings.

### üîÑ Data Preprocessing
A configurable pipeline prepares raw signals:
* **Windowing:** Segments data (default: 30s, >95 Hz sampling rate).
* **Standardization:** Zero-mean, unit-variance normalization.
* **Filtering:** Band-pass Welch filter (HR: 0.5-3 Hz, RR: 0.1-0.5 Hz).
* **DiffNorm:** Differentiation + normalization to enhance periodic signals.
* **Spectral Analysis:** Frequency-domain transformation.

### üîç Physics-based Methods
RingTool includes traditional signal processing algorithms:
* **Peak Detection:** Estimates HR/RR from detected peaks in filtered signals.

```math
\text{Rate (per minute)} = \frac{60 \times \text{Number of peaks}}{\text{Window duration (seconds)}}
```
* **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT):** Estimates HR/RR from the peak frequency ($f_{peak}$) in the signal's spectrum.

```math
\text{HR (bpm)} = 60 \times f_{peak} \quad (f_{peak} \in [0.5, 3] \text{ Hz})
```

```math
\text{RR (breaths/min)} = 60 \times f_{peak} \quad (f_{peak} \in [0.1, 0.5] \text{ Hz})
```
* **Ratio-Based SpO2:** Calculates SpO2 using the ratio of AC/DC components from red and infrared PPG signals.

```math
R = \frac{AC_{red}/DC_{red}}{AC_{infrared}/DC_{infrared}}
```

```math
\text{SpO2 (\%)} = a - b \times R
```

(Coefficients $a, b$ depend on sensor type, e.g., $a \approx 99, b \approx 6$ for reflective; $a \approx 87, b \approx -6$ for transmissive).


All code for physics-based methods is implemented in [`unsupervised`](unsupervised).


### üöÜ Supervised Methods
#### Deep Learning Models
RingTool includes four deep learning backbones adapted for multi-channel physiological time-series regression:

* **ResNet (He et al., 2016):** Uses residual connections to enable deeper networks for complex regression tasks (e.g., BP estimation) by mitigating vanishing gradients. Configurable depth, filters, etc. See [`nets/resnet.py`](nets/resnet.py).
* **InceptionTime (Ismail Fawaz et al., 2020):** Employs multi-scale convolutional filters to capture patterns at different temporal resolutions simultaneously (e.g., fast cardiac events and slow respiratory cycles). Configurable modules, kernel sizes. See [`nets/inception_time.py`](nets/inception_time.py).
* **Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017):** Leverages self-attention to model complex, long-range dependencies within and across channels, useful for signals with extended temporal variations. Configurable heads, layers. See [`nets/transformer.py`](nets/transformer.py).
* **Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023):** A recent state space model offering linear-time complexity for long sequences and potentially better handling of motion artifacts via selective state updates. Configurable state dimension, blocks. See [`nets/mamba2.py`](nets/mamba2.py).

#### Training Protocol
A standardized framework is used:
* **Tasks:** Single-task regression (HR, RR, SpO2, BP).
* **Validation:** 5-fold cross-validation (subject-independent).
* **Defaults:** 200 epochs, batch size 128, MSE loss, Adam optimizer (LR $1 \times 10^{-3}$).
* **Optimization:** Supports hyperparameter tuning, uses validation set performance for model selection (best epoch saved), includes early stopping.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** MAE, RMSE, MAPE, Pearson correlation coefficient.


## üöÄ Usage
### üìã Prerequisites
The project depends on several Python libraries and tools, including [`PyTorch`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [`mamba-ssm`](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba), [`Triton`](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton) etc. Detailed packages and versions are listed in [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt).

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation
We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects. You can create a virtual environment using [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [`conda`](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/main) or [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: The requirements file is tested with CUDA 11.8. If you are using a different CUDA version, please make sure to install the correct version of PyTorch, Triton, mamba-ssm as well as other packages. You can find the correct Triton version match [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/triton-inference-server/release-notes/rel-24-03.html).

Using `venv`:
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Using `conda`:
```sh
conda create -n ringtool python=3.10
conda activate ringtool
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Using `uv`:
```sh
uv venv --python 3.10
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üí® Running the Code
We have already packed a set of configurations for you to run the code. You can find them in the [`config`](config) folder. Below commands will run the training and evaluation of all the methods in the corresponding configuration files.

#### Unsupervised Methods
```sh
python3 main.py --data-path <replace-with-your-data-path> --batch-configs-dirs config/physical-based
```

#### Supervised Methods
For supervised methods' training and evaluation, use the following command:
```sh
nohup python3 main.py --data-path <replace-with-your-data-path> --batch-configs-dirs config/supervised > $(date +\%Y\%m\%d\%H\%M\%S)-nohup-train.log 2>&1 &
```
> Note you are expected to wait for quite a while for the whole batch training to finish. On an NVIDIA RTX 3090, it takes about 13 hours to finish the training and evaluation of all the methods in the configuration files.

For direct testing, use:
```sh
nohup python3 main.py --data-path <replace-with-your-data-path> --batch-configs-dirs config/only_test > $(date +\%Y\%m\%d\%H\%M\%S)-nohup-test.log 2>&1 &
```

If you do not want to run the whole batch training, you can also run a specific configuration file. For example, to run the [`resnet-ring1-hr-all-ir.json`](config/supervised/ring1/hr/ir/resnet-ring1-hr-all-ir.json), you can use the following command:
```sh
python3 main.py --data-path <replace-with-your-data-path> --config config/supervised/ring1/hr/ir/resnet-ring1-hr-all-ir.json
```

If you want to integrate Slack bot notifications, you can add the `--send-notification-slack` argument to the command. This will send notifications to a specified Slack channel when the training ends. See Also [How to slack training bot](notifications/README.md).



#### Physiological Range Filtering
The training pipeline includes physiological range filtering to improve model quality by removing samples with physiologically impossible values. Filtering is applied during training and validation phases, but not during testing to evaluate true model performance.

**Physiological ranges defined:**
- Heart rate (HR): 40-200 bpm
- Respiratory rate (RR): 4-30 breaths/min
- Blood oxygen saturation (SpO2): 75-100%
- Systolic blood pressure (SBP): 60-260 mmHg
- Diastolic blood pressure (DBP): 30-200 mmHg

The filtering is automatically applied in the standard training pipeline. Custom ranges can be specified via the `physiological_filter()` function in [`utils/utils.py`](utils/utils.py).

#### Detailed Prediction Pairs
To save detailed prediction pairs during training for subsequent analysis, use the `--save-predictions` flag:
```sh
python3 main.py --data-path <path> --config <config.json> --save-predictions
```

This generates CSV files in `predictions/<exp_name>/<fold>.csv` with the following format:
```csv
prediction,target,task,fold,exp_name
75.68,78.0,hr,Fold-1,resnet-ring1-hr-all-ir
82.31,80.0,hr,Fold-1,resnet-ring1-hr-all-ir
```

#### Batch Testing with Metadata
For batch testing all trained models and generating predictions with complete metadata (subject ID, scenario, timestamps), use:
```sh
python3 test_all_models_predictions.py
```

This script:
- Automatically finds all trained models in the `models/` directory
- Tests each model across all folds
- Generates detailed predictions with metadata:
  ```csv
  prediction,target,subject_id,scenario,start_time,end_time,task,exp_name
  76.68,101.73,00023,sitting,1742822979.47,1742823009.47,hr,resnet-ring1-hr-all-ir
  ```
- Saves results to `predictions/<exp_name>/<fold>.csv`

**Testing specific models:**
```sh
python3 test_all_models_predictions.py --models resnet-ring1-hr-all-ir inception-time-ring1-hr-all-irred
```

This is particularly useful for paper reproduction and detailed performance analysis across subjects and scenarios.
